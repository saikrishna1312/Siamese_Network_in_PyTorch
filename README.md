# Siamese Network in PyTorch
Implemented a Siamese Network, train the network with the Triplet loss function. We will create a Anchor, Positive, Negative image dataset, which will be the inputs of the Triplet loss function, through which the network will learn feature embeddings. Siamese Network have plethora of applications such as facial recognition, signature checking, person re-identification, etc. In this porject, we have trained a Siamese network for person re-identification.
